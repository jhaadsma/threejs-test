**Threejs demo**

Loaded a GLTF 3d character model with three.js. 


I roughly followed the tutorial on discoverthreejs.com. This is an excellent interactive e-book with a built in IDE (although I did not use it in this isntance) that explains three.js and 3d modeling concepts for begginers or advanced users, and its free!

I deviated from the tutorial a bit by omitting some features I did not need as well as using my own character model. 


I plan on further developing this project by having it be a website that will display randomized human 3D character models (https://github.com/jhaadsma/Blender-MB-Lab-mass-character-generator)
